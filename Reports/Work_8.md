## Explanation:
On the screenshots you can see that I added different argparse so several hyper-parameters could be chosen via terminal. (learning_rate, epochs, batch_size and BatchNorm function).







## Questions:



### Question 1:
I didn't manage to implement BatchNormSimple. I dont understand how to realize u_train and o_train values.

### Question 2:
I have several problems with r2 score.W When I try to calculate it - NaN values occurre.

### Question 3:
I didn't manage to find required datasets that were alredy used in other scientific papers. All of those I found - were related to image datasets.
